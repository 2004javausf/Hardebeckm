in Java we have primitive and reference data types
primitive - 8 types; just a value
char
boolean - 1 bit
byte - 8 bit
short - 16 bit
int - 32 bit
long - 64 bit
float - 32 bit
double - 64 bit

Reference - an object;

java is a passes by value.
passes the values of the references rather than the references themselves.
numeric type conversions
	look out for loss of precision
